// Ported verbatim from Muesli-HQ/muesli (native/MuesliNative/Sources/MuesliNativeApp/MeetingSession.swift,
// lines 8-92 -- `MeetingChunkCollector` was a top-level type in the donor's MeetingSession.swift,
// split into its own file here since this fork's MeetingSession port (`MeetingEngine.swift`) is
// itself a large file. No behavior change; `SpeechSegment` resolves to this fork's own type.
